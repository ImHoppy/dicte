# Dicte

## What is it?
Dicte is a small project for writing dictations and verifying the text provided by the client. <br />
Using React and Socket.io for the client and only Socket.io for the server, each time a user writes in their textbox, it will be broadcast to each admin.
The admin can also see if the user is not focusing on the window.

## Start in dev mode
Server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Client:
```sh
cd client
npm run dev
```
